        <h2>1850s</h2>
        <img src="images/history/1850rail.jpg" alt="Historical Map" class="centered-image">
        <p>The construction of railroads was important to the development of Edinburgh as they allowed for easier movement of goods and people throughout the city. In the 1850s, two railway companies were increasing their coverage in the city: the North British Railway Company (NBR) and the Caledonian Railway (CR). In 1861 CR opened a branch from the city centre, near Haymarket, to the harbour in Granton. This was significant because the Forth Rail Bridge hadn’t yet been built so they needed a route to quickly and efficiently transport goods. This was supported by the Duke of Buccleuch, but his shares were bought out by CR in 1863. They expanded the line east towards the ports in Leith from Crewe Junction which opened in 1864.</p>
        <p>Up to this point the lines were only used for goods transport, but in 1878 they opened lines for passenger travel. The terminus in Leith was first called Leith then Leith North (1903) and finally North Leith (1952), which gets confusing when trying to research its history! The CR terminal in the city centre was originally on Lothian Road but moved to the west end of Princes St in 1870, Princes Street Station. The original station burned down in 1890 but was rebuilt and is currently the Caledonian Hotel. Their competitor, NBR, had a station on the east end of Princes St which is now the Balmoral. The North Leith line had five stations between the two terminals: Murrayfield, Granton, East Pilton, Craigleith, and Newhaven. The remnants of some of these stations can still be seen when using the path. </p>

        <p>Between these photos you can see Granton Road Station in the 1940s and 2024. The angle is not quite right, but you can still see evidence of the platform edge (where there is now a fence). On the far left of the other modern photo you can see the other edge of the platform that is now covered in ivy. </p>

        <p>It may look like a short wall, but it is actually part of the platform at Craigleith Station! The yellow, brown, and white building on top of the bridge is the station building that has been turned into offices. </p>

        <h2>1900s</h2>
        <p>Passengers used the line to travel to and from the city centre, but was also used by workers for commuting. This was important for lessening urban fragmentation in Edinburgh which the current path still does by encouraging travel between Leith and Roseburn. In 1923, CR was absorbed into the London, Midland, and Scottish Railway (LMS) which was then nationalised and became British Railways (BR) in 1948. These changes showed the popularity of the railway both for business and passenger use. </p>

    <section>
        <h2>1950s</h2>
        <p>Though the railways had been popular, there were 40 services in the 1930s, they began to decline in popularity in the 1950s. Both CR and NBR viewed each other as their only competitors, but failed to see the trams and buses as competition. Tram and bus routes were more convenient with stations located in more accessible places causing a decline in railway popularity. The trams were also electrified in the 1920s which increased their popularity. Passenger travel from North Leith ceased in 1962 with little public fanfare. Over the next 5 years goods transport gradually ended with the final station closing in 1968. After the railway closed, the train path cut through the city still remained and was converted into a cycle and pedestrian path between the 1980s and 1990s. </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>2000s</h2>
        <p>The path has remained a cycle and pedestrian path since its conversion in the late 20th century. It provides a space for recreation and exercise as well as a route for travel between different parts of the city. Unknowingly to many people, it also preserves a part of the railway history in Edinburgh. People can still walk along the path the train would have taken 100 years ago and see parts of the platforms along the way. There are also other examples of railways turning into pedestrian paths in Edinburgh. For example, the NBR route from Granton to Princes St is now Trinity Path and the Innocent Railway south of Holyrood Park was another NBR route. This history provides an interesting anecdote to the tram conversation in Edinburgh today. Trams had a part in the decline of the railway and again threaten the same infrastructure that has embraced its new purpose as a green corridor. It provides a home for different animal and plant species as well as space that allows people to recreate, exercise, and enjoy the greenspaces of Edinburgh.  </p>
